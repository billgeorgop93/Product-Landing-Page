      <h1>Our History <i class="fa fa-history"></i></h1>
      <h3>More than 150 years of history</h3>
      <p>The variety of communicational material always targeted on the connection of Fix with people, things, trends and facts. Several labels – many of which have been awarded through the years- posters of any kind and thematic advertisements, product
        promotion in beloved movies and many many more...
        As a result, it is impossible for the Greek consumer to erase from his/her memory all those images where groups of celebrities or not, raise their glasses of Fix to enjoy themselves!
        This journey and of course all those images are strongly connected with the latest history of Greece and this history will always have one thing in common. A Fix label.
        Moreover, through this journey of decades it is proved that for its people, Fix beer is
        not just a simple – common product. It is the heart of the Greek way of living and Greeks’ daily life.</p>

      <h2>Premium Dark Lager</h2>
      <p>FIX Dark, the dark premium lager beer of Olympic Brewery was presented for the first time to the Greek market in February 2012.
        Its features make it not only a special pleasure option but mostly a source of inspiration for the creation of a new category of beer which enriches the range of consumers’ options.
        Its special taste and flavors fascinate the consumers since the very first sip and the special recipe of FIX Dark was well preserved for many decades. In particular, FIX beer is
        closely associated with the times when the visitors of the International Fair of Thessaloniki were running up to the FIX pavilion for a frozen dark beer, which was produced especially for the Fair.
        As a result, based on the historic character and the values of FIX brand, FIX Dark, the genuinely Greek subversive option, FIX Dark, carries on the tradition!</p>
